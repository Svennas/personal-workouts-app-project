# Project Description
We will construct a website where training programs can be created by users with either predefined exercises or exercises that the users themself create. The exercises will be categorised depending if they belong to “Warm up”, “Strength”, or “Yoga”. These categories will be colour coded.

The website will be constructed using React.


The backend-functionality will be an REST API constructed using Java Spring and JPA.

The website will use Spring Security in conjunction with PostgreSQL to create the login function where different users can login using a username and password. Created exercises and programs will be connected to the users via SQL-tables.

All data will be handled using PostgreSQL.
